Project 4

The main idea of my P4 is creating sort of microblog with the book reviews. Users can post their recent reviews and upload photo of the book cover.

I decided to make my P4 on the basis of my P2 by improving it step by step as PHP and JS was new to me and moving forward in small steps will be more relevant than being stuck with some bigger completely new project.

So, I improved my microbog with these features: 


- Email format validation while signing in or logging in (JavaScript).
- Posts control panel displays number of posts, users, and the recent post date on the home page. And also the last image of the book added. (AJAX)
- After the post was added it displays on the same page without reloading the page (JavaScript AJAX Form plugin).
- User can upload an image to his post (PHP Framework).
- When user signs in he is logged in automaticaly (PHP Framework).
- User is following himself from the moment of registration.
